in every week, I forget to establish the folder in the IBI1_2024-25. I move all the folder into this folder.
in week 3 I rewrite my reflection and put it into the proper floder and also wrtie my commit message carefully
in week 4 about variables, I define  and use X Y and write the  table.  About triangles, I write more clear pseudocode. About the BMI I give the category fall.
in week 5 I just put the files into proper postion
